# Computer Science for Non-Majors

**March 22, 2016:**
I am currently looking into what kinds of computer studies / computer science courses are offered to non-majors and how the material is selected. I'm putting together a list of links around the development of computer studies courses for non-majors for Ontario post-secondary education.

* [Computer Science for Non-Majors](http://www.cccblog.org/2014/02/17/computer-science-for-non-majors/) - Not surprisingly the one of the top results for searching for this topic. A great blog post by [Ran Libeskind-Hadas](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~hadas/).
